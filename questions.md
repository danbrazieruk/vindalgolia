## Question 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

* Records
* Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

**Answer:**

Hey George,

I'd be more than happy to help guide you here, I appreciate the terminology can be daunting!

* Records: records are collections of fields, often using different types of data. I think of them like rows in a database or spreadsheet where you might be recording various information like a person's height, weight, shoe size, favourite meal etc.

* Indexing: this is a process that generally happens "behind-the-scenes". It's a method of collecting, "understanding", organising and storing data which enables faster results to user queries.

* Custom ranking: this feature can be used to boost or penalise certain records. With Algolia, results are ordered using the default ranking strategy first. This ensures that users find what they are looking for. Custom ranking can then be used to increase or decrease visibility of records. A use-case here might be to suppress out-of-stock products or to highlight items which receive higher ratings so that popular products appear higher in search results.

I hope the above is useful, I'd love to see what you build on the platform. Please feel free to fire other questions to myself or Support if we can help you any further.

Thanks!

## Question 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

**Answer:**

Hi Matt,

Thanks for the feedback, I understand that you're frustrated with the change here and I'll certainly pass that on to our Platform Engineering team.

With regards to helping you navigate this, have you considered using Algolia's API? There's a useful [clearObjects](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/) method that might save you some clicks?

Let me know if that solves the issue for you, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks, Dan

## Question 3:
Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo

**Answer:**

Hi Leo,

This will largely depend on the make-up of your website. We have a range of integrations that you can check out on our [Developer Hub](https://www.algolia.com/developers/#integrations).

At a high-level, the core steps are:

* Index your data via the Algolia dashboard or API
* Configure initial relevance settings
* Build out your search interface

For a little more color here, you could also check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/).

I'd love to work with you to understand more about your project. I'll introduce you to a colleague on our Sales Team who can liaise with you to get all of the pertinent information and we can work together from there to find the best solution for you.

Speak to you soon,
Dan
